# RAINFALL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts whether rainfall will occur based on various weather parameters. It is a classification problem where the target variable is rain (Yes/No). The model has been trained and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive UI.

## ✨ Features
  - Predicts rainfall occurrence based on meteorological data.
  - User-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
  - Supports real-time predictions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (for model development)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Streamlit (for deploying the ML model)

## 📊 Dataset Details
- The dataset consists of 70,963 samples with the following features:
- conds (Weather conditions)
- hum (Humidity)
- pressurem (Pressure)
- vism (Visibility)
- wdird, wdire (Wind direction in degrees and cardinal)
- wspdm (Wind speed)
- datetime, hour, day, month, weekday (Date-time features)
- dew_point (Dew point temperature)
- wind_chill (Wind chill factor)
## 🏗 Model Training
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed.
- The dataset was balanced to avoid bias in classification.
- The model achieved 100% accuracy after balancing.
## 🖥 Deployment
- The model is deployed using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface. The UI includes:
- Input fields for weather conditions.
- A predict button to classify rainfall occurrence.
- Visualization of weather parameters.
